# Automatically save and load buffers for a kak session.
#
# This is just a private thing for my use, unless it grows enough warts to
# want to share with the world . . .
#
# The basic idea is to keep a file containing the list of buffers that are
# open, so that we can load them again when we restart next time - retaining
# some state about the previous work we were doing. In theory we could make
# this into a very sophisticated mechanism of tracking working history, but
# that's totally not worth the trouble - keeping the buffer list is absolutely
# Good Enough(tm) for my use case.
